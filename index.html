 <P><I>Space Ace</I> is an up-and-coming game by Reagan Scott. Play as Cecelia, a spunky mechanic on the space ship <I>"Dawn's Light"</I> as she and the rest of the crew explores the cosmos!
 Led by their captain Eleanore Genti, Cecelia works alongside her sister B, a gentle giant by the name of Fabio, and an increasingly curious AI known as 604-2a.
 Not everything is peaceful in outer space, though. There are rumors of beasts the size of stars, and the farther away from Earth's colonies explorers wander, the less likely they are to return home...
 In a game where choices you make will affect the outcome, it's up to you to negotiate with mysterious aliens, save your sister from herself, and... Teach a robot to love?</P>
